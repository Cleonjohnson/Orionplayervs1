## Orion logo and banner (4K TV–friendly)

- **Files:** `OrionLogo.png`, `OrionBanner.png`
- **Used in:** Loading screen, Device Select, Hub, Home, GameHub, Settings. All logo `Image` components use `resizeMode="contain"` to prevent distortion.
- **Resolution:** Use **at least 1024×1024 pixels** (or 1024×512 for wide banners) so the logo stays sharp on 50" 4K TVs and Android TV/Firestick. A small phone-sized PNG will look pixelated (fuzzy) on large screens.
- **Replace:** Export your logo at 1024×1024 (or higher) and overwrite these files. PNG with transparent background works best.

## Culture FM logo

- **File:** `culture-fm-logo.png`
- **Used in:** Floating Radio bar, Radio screen (Culture FM 96.5 card), and Player when listening to Culture FM.
- **Replace:** Copy your Culture FM circular logo (gold ring, 96.5, "Tune in, Wise up, Get Cultured") here and overwrite `culture-fm-logo.png` for full branding. PNG with transparent background works best. For TV, use at least 512×512.
